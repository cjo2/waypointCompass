waypointCompass
===============

A waypoint manager for Bukkit servers. I built this to remedy the lack of minimap mods for the 1.7.4 version of Minecraft.

Commands
---------------
* wc mark {name} [private]
* wc remove {name}
* wc goto {name}
* wc list

To do
---------------
* Add persistent data storage (probably SQLite)
